# NotionGlaze-HUMANERD Project Blueprint

## Project Overview
This project is an **Astro.js** based web application designed for high performance and scalability using Cloudflare's infrastructure. It likely integrates with the Notion API (based on recent conversation history) to render content dynamically.

## Project Details
- **Frontend Framework:** Astro.js (^5.16.4)
- **UI Frameworks:** React (^19.2.3)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (^4.1.18)
- **Deployment Platform:** Cloudflare (via Wrangler/Cloudflare Pages)
- **Key Features:**
  - Notion-like rendering experience.
  - Saju analysis architecture (mentioned in history).
  - Cloudflare Worker integration.

## Current State & Changes
### Deployment Workflow Transition
The user is currently transitioning or clarifying their deployment workflow. They are using `npx wrangler deploy` to push changes directly to Cloudflare.

### Plan for Current Task
1. **Explain the difference** between manual deployment (`wrangler`) and automated CI/CD (`git push`).
2. **Emphasize the importance of `git push`** for version control and safety, even if it's not the primary deployment trigger.
3. **Provide guidance** on which workflow is recommended.
